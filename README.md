Hello YouTuber friends! I'm Sensei Katie, and I'm so happy to have had you guys this week. 
As someone who has been on YouTube since 2010- I've seen todays stars at their beginnings.
Low quality videos, uncomfortable shuffling behind the camera, awkward jokes.
You, Ninjas, finished the hardest step; starting. Now its time to hone those skills and become a star yourself.

On the right side (desktop), you sould see a green tab titled RELEASES. Each kid's file is titled with their YouTube name/handle.

KIDS AND THEIR HANDLES:
Finn is Scruffaloe, Xaiden is GamerGuyZ, Vincent is LeonStuff, Rowan is CoolDude, Takoa is Hatter, and Gavin is Gibbs.
