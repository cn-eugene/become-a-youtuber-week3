Hello YouTuber friends! I'm Sensei Katie, and I'm so happy to have had you guys this week. 
As someone who has been on YouTube since 2010- I've seen todays stars at their beginnings.
Low quality videos, uncomfortable shuffling behind the camera, awkward jokes.
These Ninjas finished the hardest step, which was starting.
YT is an awesome platform with so much opportunity; and I hope to see these Ninjas tackle it.
